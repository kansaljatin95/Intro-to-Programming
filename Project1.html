        <h1 id="Intro">INTRO TO HTML</h1>
        <h2 id="html">Q1)-What is <sup>Html?</sup></h2>
       <p class="style"> Ans1)-HTML is a markup language for describing web documents (web pages).<br>

a)HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.<br>
b)A markup language is a set of markup tags.<br>
c)HTML documents are described by HTML tags.<br>
            d)Each HTML tag describes different document content.<br>
</p>

<h2 id="html2">Q2)-What are HTML <sup>Tags?</h2></sup>
<p class="style">Ans2)-HTML tags are keywords (tag names) surrounded by angle brackets:

&lt; tagname &gt; content goes here...&lt;/tagname&gt;
HTML tags normally come in pairs like p
The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag
The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a forward slash inserted before the tag name</p>
<br>

<h2 id="markup">Q3)-What is markup in <sup>Html?</sup></h2>
<p class="style">Ans3)-Markup languages are designed for the processing, definition and presentation of text. The language specifies code for formatting, both the layout and style, within a text file. The code used to specify the formatting are called tags. HTMLis a an example of a widely known and used markup language.</p>
<h2 id="hyper">Q4)-What is hypertext in <sup>Html?</sup></h2>
<p class="style"> Ans4)-Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.
Hypertext is text which contains links to other texts. The term was coined by Ted Nelson around 1965 (see History ).

HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video and sound.
<h1 id="history">HISTORY OF HTML</h1>
<h2 id="dev">DEVELOPMENT</h2></p>
<p class="style">In 1980, physicist<font color=blue> Tim Berners-Lee</font>, then a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer<font color=blue> Robert Cailliau </font>collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</p>
        
        <p class="style">The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by<font color=blue> SGMLguid</font>, an in-house<font color=blue> Standard Generalized Markup Language</font> (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.</p><br>
<h2 id="htmlversion">HTML VERSION TIMELINE</h2>
<b>November 24, 1995</b><br>
        <h2> HTML 2.0 was published as IETF<font color=blue> RFC 1866</font>. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:<br></h2>
    <ul type=disc>
        <li>November 25, 1995:<font color=blue> RFC 1867</font></li>
        <li>May 1996:<font color=blue> RFC 1942</font></li>

        <li>January 1997:<font color=blue>RFC 2070</font></li>
    </ul>
    <b>January 14, 1997</b><br>
    <p class="style">HTML 3.2 was published as a<font color=blue> W3C Recommendation</font>. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.</p>
    <p class="style">Initially code-named "Wilbur", HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of<font color=blue> Netscape's</font> visual markup tags. Netscape's<font color=blue> blink element</font> and <font color=blue>Microsoft's marquee element</font> were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies. A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in <font color=blue>MathML</font>.</p>
    <b>December 18, 1997</b><br>
    HTML 4.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:
    <ul type=disc>
        <li>Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden</li>
        <li>Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed</li>
        <li>Frameset, in which mostly only<font color=blue> frame</font> related elements are allowed.</li></ul>
    <p class="style">Initially code-named "Cougar", HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but at the same time sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as <font color=blue>deprecated</font> in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879  SGML.</p>
    <b>April 24, 1998</b><br>
    HTML 4.0 was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.
    <br>
    <b>December 24, 1999</b>
    <p class="style">HTML 4.01 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last<font color=blue> errata</font> were published on May 12, 2001.</p>
    <b>May 2000</b>
    <p class="style">ISO/IEC 15445:2000 ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard. In the ISO this standard falls in the domain of the <font color=blue>ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34 </font>(ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 â€“ Document description and processing languages).</p>
    <p class="style">After HTML 4.01, there was no new version of HTML for many years as development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group through the early and mid-2000s.</p>
    <b>October 28, 2014</b>
    <p class="style">HTML5 was published as a W3C Recommendation.</p>
<h1 id="mark">MARKUP</h1>
<p class="style">HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h1&gt;, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example &lt;img&gt;. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>
        <p class="style">Another important component is the HTML<font color=blue> document type declaration</font>, which triggers <font color=blue>standards mode </font>rendering.</p>
        <p class="style">The following is an example of the classic<font color=blue> Hello world program</font>, a common test employed for comparing<font color=blue> programming languages, scripting languages</font> and <font color=blue>markup languages</font>. This example is made using 9 lines of code:</p>
        <p class="style">(The text between &lt;html&gt; and &lt;/html&gt; describes the web page, and the text between &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; is the visible page content. The markup text "&lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;" defines the browser page title.)</p>
        <p class="style">The Document Type Declaration &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is for HTML5. If a declaration is not included, various browsers will revert to <font color=blue>"quirks mode" </font>for rendering.</p>
<h2 id="ele">ELEMENTS</h2><br>

        <p class="style">HTML documents imply a structure of nested<font color=blue> HTML elements</font>. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets thus:&lt;p&gt;</p>
        <p class="style">In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag" &lt;p&gt; and "end tag" &lt;/p&gt;. The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.</p>
        <p class="style">Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.</p>
        <p class="style">The start tag may also include attributes within the tag. These indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the &lt;img&gt; used to embed images, the reference to the image resource.</p>
        <p class="style">Some elements, such as the<font color=blue> line break</font> &lt;br&gt;, do not permit any embedded content, either text or further tags. These require only a single empty tag (akin to a start tag) and do not use an end tag.</p>
        <p class="style">Many tags, particularly the closing end tag for the very commonly used paragraph element &lt;p&gt;, are optional. An HTML browser or other agent can infer the closure for the end of an element from the context and the structural rules defined by the HTML standard. These rules are complex and not widely understood by most HTML coders.</p>
        <p class="style">The general form of an HTML element is therefore: &lt;tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2"&gt;''content''&lt;/tag&gt;. Some HTML elements are defined as empty elements and take the form &lt;tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2"&gt;. Empty elements may enclose no content, for instance, the &lt;br&gt; tag or the inline &lt;img&gt; tag. The name of an HTML element is the name used in the tags. Note that the end tag's name is preceded by a slash character, "/", and that in empty elements the end tag is neither required nor allowed. If attributes are not mentioned, default values are used in each case.</p>
        <img src="Capture.PNG">
<h2 id="attr">Attributes</h2>
        <p class="style">Most of the attributes of an element are<font color=blue><i> name-value pairs</i></font>, separated by "=" and written within the start tag of an element after the element's name. The value may be enclosed in single or double quotes, although values consisting of certain characters can be left unquoted in HTML (but not XHTML). Leaving attribute values unquoted is considered unsafe. In contrast with name-value pair attributes, there are some attributes that affect the element simply by their presence in the start tag of the element, like the ismap attribute for the img element.</p>
        <p class="style">There are several common attributes that may appear in many elements :</p>
        <p class="style">The id attribute provides a document-wide unique identifier for an element. This is used to identify the element so that stylesheets can alter its presentational properties, and scripts may alter, animate or delete its contents or presentation. Appended to the URL of the page, it provides a globally unique identifier for the element, typically a sub-section of the page. For example, the ID "Attributes" in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#Attributes</p>
        <p class="style">The class attribute provides a way of classifying similar elements. This can be used for semantic or presentation purposes. For example, an HTML document might semantically use the designation class="notation" to indicate that all elements with this class value are subordinate to the main text of the document. In presentation, such elements might be gathered together and presented as footnotes on a page instead of appearing in the place where they occur in the HTML source. Class attributes are used semantically in<font color=blue> microformats</font>. Multiple class values may be specified; for example class="notation important" puts the element into both the "notation" and the "important" classes.</p>
        <p class="style">An author may use the style attribute to assign presentational properties to a particular element. It is considered better practice to use an element's id or class attributes to select the element from within a stylesheet, though sometimes this can be too cumbersome for a simple, specific, or ad hoc styling.</p>
        <p class="style">The title attribute is used to attach subtextual explanation to an element. In most <font color=blue>browsers</font> this attribute is displayed as a<font color=blue> tooltip</font>.</p>
        <p class="style">The lang attribute identifies the natural language of the element's contents, which may be different from that of the rest of the document.</p>
<h1 id="sem">SEMANTIC HTML</h1>
<p class="style">Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the encoded information over its presentation (look). HTML has included semantic markup from its inception, but has also included presentational markup, such as &lt;font&gt;, &lt;i&gt; and &lt;center&lt; tags. There are also the semantically neutral<font color=blue> span and div</font> tags. Since the late 1990s when <font color=blue>Cascading Style Sheets</font> were beginning to work in most browsers, web authors have been encouraged to avoid the use of presentational HTML markup with a view to the <font color=blue>separation of presentation and content</font>.</p>

<p class="style">In a 2001 discussion of the <font color=blue>Semantic Web, Tim Berners-Lee</font> and others gave examples of ways in which intelligent software "agents" may one day automatically crawl the web and find, filter and correlate previously unrelated, published facts for the benefit of human users.[69] Such agents are not commonplace even now, but some of the ideas of <font color=blue>Web 2.0, mashups</font> and price comparison websites may be coming close. The main difference between these web application hybrids and Berners-Lee's semantic agents lies in the fact that the current<font color=blue> aggregation</font> and hybridization of information is usually designed in by<font color=blue> web developers</font>, who already know the web locations and the<font color=blue> API semantics</font> of the specific data they wish to mash, compare and combine.</p>

<p class="style">An important type of web agent that does crawl and read web pages automatically, without prior knowledge of what it might find, is the web <font color=blue>crawler</font> or search-engine spider. These software agents are dependent on the semantic clarity of web pages they find as they use various techniques and<font color=blue> algorithms</font> to read and index millions of web pages a day and provide web users with<font color=blue> search facilities</font> without which the World Wide Web's usefulness would be greatly reduced.</p>

<p class="style">In order for search-engine spiders to be able to rate the significance of pieces of text they find in HTML documents, and also for those creating mashups and other hybrids as well as for more automated agents as they are developed, the semantic structures that exist in HTML need to be widely and uniformly applied to bring out the meaning of published text.</p>

<p class="style">Presentational markup tags are <font color=blue>deprecated</font> in current HTML and <font color=blue>XHTML</font> recommendations and are illegal in HTML5.</p>

<p class="style"> Good semantic HTML also improves the <font color=blue>accessibility</font> of web documents (see also <font color=blue>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)</font>. For example, when a screen reader or audio browser can correctly ascertain the structure of a document, it will not waste the visually impaired user's time by reading out repeated or irrelevant information when it has been marked up correctly.</p>
<h1 id="del">DELIVERY</h1>
<p class="style">HTML documents can be delivered by the same means as any other computer file. However, they are most often delivered either by<font color=blue> HTTP </font>from a <font color=blue>web server</font> or by<font color=blue> email.</font>

</p>
<h2 id="http">HTTP</h2>
<p class="style">
    The<font color=blue> World Wide Web</font> is composed primarily of HTML documents transmitted from web servers to web browsers using the<font color=blue> Hypertext Transfer Protocol</font> (HTTP). However, HTTP is used to serve images, sound, and other content, in addition to HTML. To allow the web browser to know how to handle each document it receives, other information is transmitted along with the document. This <font color=blue>meta data</font> usually includes the MIME type (e.g. text/html or application/xhtml+xml) and the character encoding (see<font color=blue> Character encoding in HTML).</font>
</p>
<p class="style">
    In modern browsers, the MIME type that is sent with the HTML document may affect how the document is initially interpreted. A document sent with the XHTML MIME type is expected to be <font color=blue>well-formed</font> XML; syntax errors may cause the browser to fail to render it. The same document sent with the HTML MIME type might be displayed successfully, since some browsers are more lenient with HTML.
</p>
<p class="style">
    The W3C recommendations state that XHTML 1.0 documents that follow guidelines set forth in the recommendation's Appendix C may be labeled with either MIME Type. XHTML 1.1 also states that XHTML 1.1 documents should be labeled with either MIME type.
</p>
<h2 id="email">HTTP E-Mail</h2>
<p class="style">
    Most graphical email clients allow the use of a subset of HTML (often ill-defined) to provide formatting and <font color=blue>semantic</font> markup not available with<font color=blue> plain text.</font> This may include typographic information like coloured headings, emphasized and quoted text, inline images and diagrams. Many such clients include both a <font color=blue>GUI</font> editor for composing HTML e-mail messages and a rendering engine for displaying them. Use of HTML in e-mail is criticized by some because of compatibility issues, because it can help disguise <font color=blue>phishing</font> attacks, because of accessibility issues for blind or visually impaired people, because it can confuse<font color=blue> spam </font>filters and because the message size is larger than plain text.
</p>
<h2 id="name">NAMING CONVENTIONS</h2>
<p class="style">
    The most common <font color=blue>filename extension</font> for<font color=blue> files</font> containing HTML is .html. A common abbreviation of this is .htm, which originated because some early operating systems and file systems, such as<font color=blue> DOS</font> and the limitations imposed by<font color=blue> FAT</font> data structure, limited file extensions to<font color=blue> three</font> letters.
    </p>
<h2 id="app">HTTP Application</h2>
<p class="style">
    An HTML Application (HTA; file extension ".hta") is a <font color=blue>Microsoft Windows</font> application that uses HTML and Dynamic HTML in a<font color=blue> browser</font> to provide the application's graphical interface. A regular HTML file is confined to the security model of the<font color=blue> web browser's security</font>, communicating only to web servers and manipulating only webpage objects and <font color=blue>site cookies.</font> An HTA runs as a fully trusted application and therefore has more privileges, like creation/editing/removal of files and<font color=blue> Windows Registry</font> entries. Because they operate outside the browser's security model, HTAs cannot be executed via HTTP, but must be downloaded (just like an<font color=blue> EXE file)</font> and executed from local file system.
