        <p class=text><b>HyperText Markup Language</b>, commonly abbreviated as<b> HTML</b>, is the standard <font color=blue> markup language</font> used to create web pages. Along with <font color=blue>CSS</font>, and <font color=blue>JavaScript</font>, HTML is a cornerstone technology used to create web pages,[1] as well as to create user interfaces for mobile and web applications. Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically and, before the advent of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), included cues for the presentation or appearance of the document (web page), making it a markup language, rather than a <font color=blue>programming language</font>.</p>
        <p class=text><font color=blue>HTML elements </font>form the building blocks of HTML pages. HTML allows images and other objects to be embedded and it can be used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create <font color=blue>structured documents </font>by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
        <p class=text>HTML can embed scripts written in languages such as JavaScript which affect the behavior of HTML web pages. HTML markup can also refer the browser to<font color=blue> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</font> to define the look and layout of text and other material. The <font color=blue>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</font>, maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p><br>

        <h2 id="dev">Development</h2>
        <p class=text>In 1980, physicist<font color=blue> Tim Berners-Lee</font>, then a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer<font color=blue> Robert Cailliau </font>collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</p>
        
        <p class=text>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by<font color=blue> SGMLguid</font>, an in-house<font color=blue> Standard Generalized Markup Language</font> (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.</p><br>

    <b>November 24, 1995</b><br>
    <p class=text>HTML 2.0 was published as IETF<font color=blue> RFC 1866</font>. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:</p>
    <ul type=disc>
        <li class=text>November 25, 1995:<font color=blue> RFC 1867</font></li>
        <li class=text>May 1996:<font color=blue> RFC 1942</font></li>

        <li class=text>January 1997:<font color=blue>RFC 2070</font></li>
    </ul>
    <b>January 14, 1997</b><br>
    <p class=text>HTML 3.2[15] was published as a<font color=blue> W3C Recommendation</font>. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.</p>
    <p class=text>Initially code-named "Wilbur",[17] HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of<font color=blue> Netscape's</font> visual markup tags. Netscape's<font color=blue> blink element</font> and <font color=blue>Microsoft's marquee element</font> were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.[13] A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in <font color=blue>MathML</font>.</p>
    <b>December 18, 1997</b>
        <p class=text>HTML 4.0[18] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:</p>
    <ul type=square>
        <li class=text>Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden</li>
        <li class=text>Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed</li>
        <li class=text>Frameset, in which mostly only<font color=blue> frame</font> related elements are allowed.</li></ul>
    <p class=text>Initially code-named "Cougar",[17] HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but at the same time sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as <font color=blue>deprecated</font> in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879  SGML.</p>
    <b>April 24, 1998</b>
        <p class=text>HTML 4.0[20] was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.</p>
    <br>
    <b>December 24, 1999</b>
    <p class=text>HTML 4.01[21] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last<font color=blue> errata</font> were published on May 12, 2001.</p>
    <b>May 2000</b>
    <p class=text>ISO/IEC 15445:2000[22][23] ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard. In the ISO this standard falls in the domain of the <font color=blue>ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34 </font>(ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 â€“ Document description and processing languages).</p>
    <p class=text>After HTML 4.01, there was no new version of HTML for many years as development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group through the early and mid-2000s.</p>
    <b>October 28, 2014</b>
    <p class=text>HTML5 was published as a W3C Recommendation.</p>
    <h3 id=html2>HTML draft version timeline</h3>
    <b>October 1991</b><br>
    <p class=text>HTML Tags,[6] an informal CERN document listing 18 HTML tags, was first mentioned in public.</p>
    <b>June 1992</b>
    <p class=text>First informal draft of the HTML DTD,[26] with seven[27][28][29] subsequent revisions (July 15, August 6, August 18, November 17, November 19, November 20, November 22)</p>
    <b>November 1992</b>
    <p class=text>HTML DTD 1.1 (the first with a version number, based on RCS revisions, which start with 1.1 rather than 1.0), an informal draft</p>
    <b>June 1993</b>
    <p class=text>Hypertext Markup Language[30] was published by the IETF IIIR Working Group as an Internet Draft (a rough proposal for a standard). It was replaced by a second version[31] one month later, followed by six further drafts published by IETF itself[32] that finally led to HTML 2.0 in <font color=blue>RFC 1866</font>.</p>
    <b>November 1993</b>
    <p class=text>/p>HTML+ was published by the IETF as an Internet Draft and was a competing proposal to the Hypertext Markup Language draft. It expired in May 1994.</p>
    <b>April 1995 (authored March 1995)</b>
    <p class=text>HTML 3.0[33] was proposed as a standard to the IETF, but the proposal expired five months later (28 September 1995)[34] without further action. It included many of the capabilities that were in Raggett's HTML+ proposal, such as support for tables, text flow around figures and the display of complex mathematical formulas.</p>
    <p class=text>W3C began development of its own <font color=blue>Arena browser</font> as a <font color=blue>test bed </font>for HTML 3 and Cascading Style Sheets,[35][36][37] but HTML 3.0 did not succeed for several reasons. The draft was considered very large at 150 pages and the pace of browser development, as well as the number of interested parties, had outstripped the resources of the IETF.[13] Browser vendors, including Microsoft and Netscape at the time, chose to implement different subsets of HTML 3's draft features as well as to introduce their own extensions to it.[13] (see <font color=blue>Browser wars</font>). These included extensions to control stylistic aspects of documents, contrary to the "belief [of the academic engineering community] that such things as text color, background texture, font size and font face were definitely outside the scope of a language when their only intent was to specify how a document would be organized."[13] Dave Raggett, who has been a W3C Fellow for many years, has commented for example: "To a certain extent, Microsoft built its business on the Web by extending HTML features."</p>
    <b>January 2008</b>
    <p class=text>HTML5 was published as a<font color=blue> Working Draft (link)</font> by the W3C.</p>
    <p class=text>Although its syntax closely resembles that of SGML, HTML5 has abandoned any attempt to be an SGML application and has explicitly defined its own "html" serialization, in addition to an alternative XML-based XHTML5 serialization.</p>
    <b>2011 HTML5 â€“ Last Call</b>
    <p class=text>On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones for HTML5. In May 2011, the working group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the target date for recommendation.[40] In January 2011, the WHATWG renamed its "HTML5" living standard to "HTML". The W3C nevertheless continues its project to release HTML5.</p>
    <b>2012 HTML5 â€“ Candidate Recommendation</b>
    <p class=text>In July 2012, WHATWG and W3C decided on a degree of separation.<font color=blue> W3C</font> will continue the HTML5 specification work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered as a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization will continue its work with HTML5 as a "Living Standard". The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved. New features can be added but functionality will not be removed.</p>
    <p class=text>In December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate Recommendation.[43] The criterion for advancement to W3C<font color=blue> Recommendation </font>is "two 100% complete and fully interoperable implementations".</p>
    <b>2014 HTML5 â€“ Proposed Recommendation and Recommendation</b>
    <p class=text>In September 2014, W3C moved HTML5 to Proposed Recommendation.</p>
    <p class=text>On 28 October 2014, HTML5 was released as a stable W3C Recommendation,[47] meaning the specification process is complete.</p>
    <h3 id="xhtml">XHTML versions</h3>
    <i class=text>Main article: XHTML</i>
    <p class=text>XHTML is a separate language that began as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 using<font color=blue> XML</font> 1.0. It is no longer being developed as a separate standard.</p>
    <ul type=circle>
        <li class=text>XHTML 1.0,[49] published January 26, 2000, as a W3C Recommendation, later revised and republished August 1, 2002. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and 4.01, reformulated in XML, with minor restrictions.</li>
        <li class=text>XHTML 1.1,[50] published May 31, 2001, as a W3C Recommendation. It is based on XHTML 1.0 Strict, but includes minor changes, can be customized, is reformulated using modules from <font color=blue>Modularization of XHTML</font>, which was published April 10, 2001, as a W3C Recommendation.</li>
        <li class=text>XHTML 2.0 was a working draft, but work on it was abandoned in 2009 in favor of work on <font color=blue>HTML5</font> and<font color=blue> XHTML5</font>. XHTML 2.0 was incompatible with XHTML 1.x and, therefore, would be more accurately characterized as an XHTML-inspired new language than an update to XHTML 1.x.</li>
        <li class=text>An XHTML syntax, known as "XHTML5.1", is being defined alongside <font color=blue>HTML5</font> in the HTML5 draft.</li>
    </ul>
        <h1 id="mark">Markup</h1>
        <p class=text>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h1&gt;, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example &lt;img&gt;. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>
        <p class=text>Another important component is the HTML<font color=blue> document type declaration</font>, which triggers <font color=blue>standards mode </font>rendering.</p>
        <p class=text>The following is an example of the classic<font color=blue> Hello world program</font>, a common test employed for comparing<font color=blue> programming languages, scripting languages</font> and <font color=blue>markup languages</font>. This example is made using 9 lines of code:</p>
        <img src="Capture.PNG">
        <p class=text>(The text between &lt;html&gt; and &lt;/html&gt; describes the web page, and the text between &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; is the visible page content. The markup text "&lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;" defines the browser page title.)</p>
        <p class=text>The Document Type Declaration &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is for HTML5. If a declaration is not included, various browsers will revert to <font color=blue>"quirks mode" </font>for rendering.</p>
        <h2 id="element">Elements</h2><br>
        <i class=text>Main article: HTML element</i>
        <p class=text>HTML documents imply a structure of nested<font color=blue> HTML elements</font>. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets thus:&lt;p&gt;</p>
        <p class=text>In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag" &lt;p&gt; and "end tag" &lt;/p&gt;. The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.</p>
        <p class=text>In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag" &lt;p&gt; and "end tag" &lt;/p&gt;. The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.</p>
        <p class=text>Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.</p>
        <p class=text>The start tag may also include attributes within the tag. These indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the &lt;img&gt; used to embed images, the reference to the image resource.</p>
        <p class=text>Some elements, such as the<font color=blue> line break</font> &lt;br&gt;, do not permit any embedded content, either text or further tags. These require only a single empty tag (akin to a start tag) and do not use an end tag.</p>
        <p class=text>Many tags, particularly the closing end tag for the very commonly used paragraph element &lt;p&gt;, are optional. An HTML browser or other agent can infer the closure for the end of an element from the context and the structural rules defined by the HTML standard. These rules are complex and not widely understood by most HTML coders.</p>
        <p class=text>The general form of an HTML element is therefore: &lt;tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2"&gt;''content''&lt;/tag&gt;. Some HTML elements are defined as empty elements and take the form &lt;tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2"&gt;. Empty elements may enclose no content, for instance, the &lt;br&gt; tag or the inline &lt;img&gt; tag. The name of an HTML element is the name used in the tags. Note that the end tag's name is preceded by a slash character, "/", and that in empty elements the end tag is neither required nor allowed. If attributes are not mentioned, default values are used in each case.</p>
        <h3 id="attr">Attributes</h3>
        <p class=text>Most of the attributes of an element are<font color=blue><i> name-value pairs</i></font>, separated by "=" and written within the start tag of an element after the element's name. The value may be enclosed in single or double quotes, although values consisting of certain characters can be left unquoted in HTML (but not XHTML) .[58][59] Leaving attribute values unquoted is considered unsafe.[60] In contrast with name-value pair attributes, there are some attributes that affect the element simply by their presence in the start tag of the element,[6] like the ismap attribute for the img element.[61]</p>
        <p class=text>There are several common attributes that may appear in many elements :</p>
        <p class=text>The id attribute provides a document-wide unique identifier for an element. This is used to identify the element so that stylesheets can alter its presentational properties, and scripts may alter, animate or delete its contents or presentation. Appended to the URL of the page, it provides a globally unique identifier for the element, typically a sub-section of the page. For example, the ID "Attributes" in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#Attributes</p>
        <p class=text>The class attribute provides a way of classifying similar elements. This can be used for semantic or presentation purposes. For example, an HTML document might semantically use the designation class="notation" to indicate that all elements with this class value are subordinate to the main text of the document. In presentation, such elements might be gathered together and presented as footnotes on a page instead of appearing in the place where they occur in the HTML source. Class attributes are used semantically in<font color=blue> microformats</font>. Multiple class values may be specified; for example class="notation important" puts the element into both the "notation" and the "important" classes.</p>
        <p class=text>An author may use the style attribute to assign presentational properties to a particular element. It is considered better practice to use an element's id or class attributes to select the element from within a stylesheet, though sometimes this can be too cumbersome for a simple, specific, or ad hoc styling.</p>
        <p class=text>The title attribute is used to attach subtextual explanation to an element. In most <font color=blue>browsers</font> this attribute is displayed as a<font color=blue> tooltip</font>.</p>
        <p class=text>The lang attribute identifies the natural language of the element's contents, which may be different from that of the rest of the document.</p>
        <h2 id="char">character and entity references</h2>
        <i class=text>See also: List of XML and HTML character entity references and Unicode and HTML</i><br>
        <p class=text>As of version 4.0, HTML defines a set of 252<font color=blue> character entity references</font> and a set of 1,114,050 <font color=blue>numeric character references</font>, both of which allow individual characters to be written via simple markup, rather than literally. A literal character and its markup counterpart are considered equivalent and are rendered identically.</p>
        <p class=text>The ability to "escape" characters in this way allows for the characters &lt; and &amp; (when written as<b> &amp;lt;</b> and <b>&amp;amp;</b> respectively) to be interpreted as character data, rather than markup. For example, a literal &lt; normally indicates the start of a tag, and &amp; normally indicates the start of a character entity reference or numeric character reference; writing it as &amp;amp; or &#x26;#x26; or &#38;#38; allows &amp; to be included in the content of an element or in the value of an attribute. The double-quote character ("), when not used to quote an attribute value, must also be escaped as &amp;quot or &amp;#x22; or &amp;#34; when it appears within the attribute value itself. Equivalently, the single-quote character ('), when not used to quote an attribute value, must also be escaped as &amp;#x27; or &amp;#39; (or as &amp;apos; in HTML5 or XHTML documents) when it appears within the attribute value itself. If document authors overlook the need to escape such characters, some browsers can be very forgiving and try to use context to guess their intent. The result is still invalid markup, which makes the document less accessible to other browsers and to other<font color=blue> user agents </font>that may try to parse the document for <font color=blue>search and indexing</font> purposes for example.</p>
        <h2 id="data">Data types</h2>
        <p class=text>HTML defines several<font color=blue> data types </font>for element content, such as script data and stylesheet data, and a plethora of types for attribute values, including IDs, names, URIs, numbers, units of length, languages, media descriptors, colors, character encodings, dates and times, and so on. All of these data types are specializations of character data.</p>
        <h2 id="doc">Document type declaration</h2>
        <p class=text>HTML documents are required to start with a<font color=blue> Document Type Declaration </font>(informally, a "doctype"). In browsers, the doctype helps to define the rendering modeâ€”particularly whether to use <font color=blue>quirks mode</font>.</p>
        <p class=text>The original purpose of the doctype was to enable parsing and validation of HTML documents by SGML tools based on the<font color=blue> Document Type Definition</font> (DTD). The DTD to which the DOCTYPE refers contains a machine-readable grammar specifying the permitted and prohibited content for a document conforming to such a DTD. Browsers, on the other hand, do not implement HTML as an application of SGML and by consequence do not read the DTD.</p>
